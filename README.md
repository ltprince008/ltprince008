Cybersecurity Student | Exploring Secure Systems, AI, and Embedded Tech\
Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science with specialization in Cybersecurity at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, KTR (Chennai)

## About Me

I'm a cybersecurity student with a deep curiosity about how things work and how they can be broken, secured, and improved. I enjoy ethical hacking, reverse-engineering simple systems, and thinking like an attacker to build better defenses. My passion lies in understanding how secure, scalable systems are designed in high-stakes industries like finance, defense, and enterprise tech. I'm actively exploring AI, system design, and web development to broaden my problem-solving toolkit.
